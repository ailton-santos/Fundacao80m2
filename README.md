Calculates the foundation area, the weight of the soil on the foundation, and the coefficient of safety of the house foundation based on the input data provided. The coefficient of safety of rupture is an indicator of the stability of the foundation and must be greater than 1 to ensure the safety of the structure. If the coefficient of safety is less than 1, it means that the foundation is not stable enough and measures must be taken to improve its stability.
